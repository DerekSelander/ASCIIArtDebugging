ASCIIArtDebugging
=================


ASCIIArtDebugging is a fun yet useful way to debug UIImage & UIImageViews in order to see what gets passed around for
the image at runtime.  Instead of just looking at the memory address or properties while debugging, ASCIIArtDebugging
takes the image and creates an ASCIIArt image in your console. 

ASCIIArtDebugging can accomidate different Xcode window console sizes as well as different types of image sizes and data 
types
